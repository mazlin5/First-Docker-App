# First-Docker-App
My first DevOps project (Oct-2022) 

Containerized Python-Flask application to return simple responses. Deployed with production WSGI server

Python-Flask apps can be run within any IDE, (VS Code) for me, at the cmd line. I've attached the cmds you would typically use to deploy this FLASK_APP:
  - flask-webapp.txt

Those dependancies were wrapped into a Dockerfile FROM an Ubuntu image.

Helpful tools to set the foundation for using Docker and integrated this technology into your workflow/deployment stack
